# dcex - dex & cex trading library

**Important**: No default broker tags are set. You may manually specify a broker tag within function arguments if needed.

> Forked from [krex](https://github.com/kairosresearchio/krex), a simplified version of the [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) Python library.

> Originally created and maintained by the same contributor, this fork continues active development, building upon the original foundation with enhanced design, unified DEX + CEX support, and fixes for previously unresolved issues.

A high-performance and lightweight Python library for interacting with cryptocurrency exchanges. dcex offers full synchronous and asynchronous support across major exchanges, designed for speed, modularity, and ease of use.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install dcex
```

or use `uv` to manage the project:

```bash
uv add dcex
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Synchronous Usage

```python
import dcex
import os

# Initialize client for any supported exchange
client = dcex.binance(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    api_secret="your_api_secret"
)

# Get market data
klines = client.get_klines(product_symbol="BTC-USDT-SWAP", interval="1h")
print(klines)
```

### Asynchronous Usage

```python
import asyncio
import dcex.async_support as dcex
import os

async def main():
    # Initialize async client
    client = await dcex.binance(
        api_key="your_api_key",
        api_secret="your_api_secret"
    )

    try:
        # Get market data
        klines = await client.get_klines(product_symbol="BTC-USDT-SWAP", interval="1h")
        print(klines)

    finally:
        await client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## What is Product Table Manager(ptm)?

Ptm is a utility that standardizes and unifies trading instrument metadata across different exchanges, making cross-exchange strategy development easier.

It is a table that contains the following columns:

| Column            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| exchange          | The exchange name                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| product_symbol    | The symbol we use to identify the product, it will be the same in different exchanges. For example, `BTC-USDT-SWAP` is the same product in Binance and Bybit, which named `BTCUSDT` in Binance and `BTC-USDT-SWAP` in OKX. |

## How to use Product Table Manager?

In most cases, we have handled the case, but if you have any specific use cases, you can use the `ptm` to get the information you want.

```python
import dcex

bn = dcex.binance()

product_symbol = bn.ptm.get_product_symbol(
    exchange="binance",
    exchange_symbol="BTCUSDT",
    product_type="swap",
)

print(product_symbol)
```
